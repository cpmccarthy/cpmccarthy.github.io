<h2>Godzilla King of Monsters</h2>
<p> Godzilla (ゴジラ, Gojira) is the King of the Monsters. He first appeared in the original Godzilla film, which was produced by Toho Company Ltd., in November 3rd, 1954. To date, Toho has produced twenty eight Godzilla films.
Godzilla is a gigantic mutant dinosaur, transformed from the fallout of an atomic bomb test. As the Godzilla series continued, the great beast was developed as a character, and has become a savior of the earth, saving the world from other monsters (usually from Outer Space) like King Ghidorah, Gigan and MechaGodzilla, along with other monsters like Rodan and Mothra.

	<h2> King Ghidorah, Triple Threat</h2>
	<p> King Ghidorah (キングギドラ, Kingu Gidora) is a three headed dragon featured in several of Toho Studios' Godzilla films. King Ghidorah is the most powerful monster in the Godzilla franchise. He is often considered Godzilla's archenemy. Usually, King Ghidorah is so destructive and powerful, that Godzilla is often required to team-up with another monster, even several monsters, before engaging the three-headed dragon of terror and destruction in battle. One exception to this theme occurred in the 1991 film Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, which included an extra powerful Godzilla defeating King Ghidorah, as well as severing King Ghidorah's middle head. Despite this setback, however, King Ghidorah is one of the few monsters who is more than a match for Godzilla under most circumstances, though there have been other monsters such as Hedorah, Destoroyah, SpaceGodzilla, and MechaGodzilla 2 who have been equally formidable opponents for Godzilla. King Ghidorah is also one of the monsters that are most often mind controlled; it acts completely autonomously in three movies, in other appearances being controlled for most of its screen time by aliens. </p>
